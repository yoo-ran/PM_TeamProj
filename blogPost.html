                <p>The coffee community has seen its fair share of trendy coffee drinks over the years. From espresso shots and cold brews to caramel macchiatos and flat whites. But in recent times, the internet was introduced to a new kid on the block - the Dalgona coffee. Or maybe we should rephrase that: Dalgona isn’t a ‘new’ concept, but it sure is something we wish were introduced to us sooner! 
                    <br><br>
                    <strong>The History of Dalgona</strong>
                    Dalgona, which is also known as whipped coffee, first originated in South Korea. The name “Dalgona” is derived from a popular sponge candy that has a similar frothy-whipped-coffee-topping look. If you’re a South Korean native, this probably isn’t news to you, but for the rest of us, this was the new trending coffee item to try. 
                    <br><br>
                    If something has been around for some time already, how did it suddenly go viral globally? Well, all thanks to a South Korean actor who featured it on a television show, the rest of the world was introduced to Dalgona coffee! The popularity of Dalgona lies also in its simplicity. With just a few basic ingredients, anyone can whip up this deliciously sweet drink in the comfort of their own home. Then ultimately, all thanks to the community of users who share their images and videos on platforms such as TikTok and Instagram, the trend started spreading like wildfire. That leads us here to us - let’s make Dalgona coffee together.
